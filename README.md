<b>Why Did I Make This Website?</b>

> <i>To Simply Answer Straightforward, I was going through a dense city and I noticed how many big screens were being shown everywhere,
> advertising products, music, etc. It made me wonder, "How Much Electricity Does This State Use Compared To The Others?". And so, I 
> researched, retrieved the live values per state, and made a website that showcased which used more/less than each other. Its also
> something cool I was interested making.</i>
